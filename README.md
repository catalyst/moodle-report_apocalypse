What is this?
-------------

This report lists activities, by type, in your site that contain flash-based content.

Support for Flash ends in mid-2019 when most browsers will disable Flash player and your content will not display. 

Some elearning authoring tools can ‘dual publish’ with HTML5 as a fallback in case Flash isn’t supported by the browser. When HTML5 content has been detected it is shown as a Yes in the ‘HTML5 present’ column.
